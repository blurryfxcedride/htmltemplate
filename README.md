# Open Source HTML Template
Whats up. Thanks for using my free open source HTML template. Please make sure to read the license, which is a GNU. Below are the insturctions on how to use the template.

# Disclaimer
I'd just like to note that you must credit me if you use this template! You can leave a link to my github page or this repository. Links are provided below.

If you do not credit me actions will be taken immediately.

# Download Visual Studio Code
Using the template isn't that hard. First of all, you need to download Visual Studio Code. Visit this link and hit the arrow next to "download for windows". Find your operating system and download the stable version. Once it is done downloading you can continue to the next step.

# Setup The Files
The next step is to setup the file. This is also pretty easy. Just make a file anywhere on your computer. Make this file in an easy to access place. For me I prefer to make the file on my desktop screen. Give the file a name which can be anything you'd like. For example, you can call it "website".

# Adding The Files To Visual Studio Code
Now just open up Visual Studio Code. Select file, which is in the upper left hand corner. A dropdown will appear. Select open folder. Then, select the folder that you made in the previous step.

# Adding The Code
All you need to do now is add a new file. Look in the explorer. Find your file name. Next to it is a few buttons. Click the new file button and name the file "index.html". Once you did that, add in the index.html code from this repository. Now you can edit the code to your liking.

# How To View Your Website
Viewing your website isn't that hard either. Just open up the file that we made earlier. Find the index.html file and right click it. Then select open. If it asks you what program to open the file with, select your default browser. For me I'd select Google Chrome.

# Enjoy
You did it! Enjoy your website! More information on how to host your website will be added soon. If you have any questions join the Discord Shop server --> https://discord.com/invite/rDZUUXwHVR
